Hi, I'm Diego, a Software Developer from São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo,
Brazil. 🇧🇷

Professionally, I have nearly a decade of experience with JavaScript,
[Node.js][nodejs], and web development in general. While I currently enjoy
working more with back-end technologies, I also have front-end experience,
particularly with [React][react].

As an open-source enthusiast, I have made some small contributions to ReactJS
in the past, particularly by translating the official documentation, as well as
to other smaller projects.
